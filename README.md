### Rules
- You have to move every turn *(you can't stay still)*
- Every time you move somewhere you leave a color trail.
- You can only move to a blank tile
- You can't move out of the map *(100 x 100)*
- You can only move to your `left`, `up` or `right`.
  *(Moving `backward` is suicide as you hit your own trail !)*
- If you take to much CPU to decide where to go, you die
- If two players moved to the same spot, they both die
- **Survive as long as you can.**

### End of the game
- Once no players can make a move
- The player with the longest trail wins

### Controls
- `space` toogle autoplay
- `right arrow` play one move
- `up arrow` increase autoplay speed
- `down arrow` lower autoplay speed
- `R` reload the same play
- `S` load a new play (new seed)
